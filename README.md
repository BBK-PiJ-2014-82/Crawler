# Crawler
Coursework 5 for Birkbeck Programming in Java

The Crawler is a web crawler that can search webpages from a given URL to a set number of links or a set depth of pages, all of
which can be provided by the user.

The Crawler is an application with a minimal text based user interface through which the user can define their starting URL and other parameters.

The Crawler has been written to use the javaDB derby database class. You will need to ensure that you have your path set to a Derby folder on your hard drive in order to compile this application.  More information abou the Derby database can be found at the following link:

The Crawler uses an embedded javaDB completely in memory.  Results from searches therefore do not persist between sessions. In this first version of the crawler the results of the search are only displayed in the system console.

Please contact James Hill for further questions about this crawler.
